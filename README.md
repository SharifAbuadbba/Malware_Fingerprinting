# Summary
This project is Malware Fingerprinting analysis

To achieve this some of the technologies utilized include:
- Python 3.8 or above
- Dataframe

# Repo Setup

This repo can be cloned from BitBucket with:

```
git clone https://bitbucket.csiro.au/scm/~abu004/malware_fingerprint.git 
```



To get the dataset, please contact Sharif Abuadbba (contact details at bottom of readme)

### Extract Feeds


```
 extract_feeds.py
```
Connects to S3 Bucket on AWS where we have raw feeds, each file contains 3K+ feeds per minute. Each feed entry is a json file. This script enumerate through json files, extract features and store as rows in CSV files. 

Output: It produces 3 CSV files.
1. feeds.csv: contains features on the file level. 
2. sections.csv: contains features on the section level and mapped to feeds file level.
3. resources.csv: contains features on the resources level and mapped to feeds file level. 


### Initial Inspection

```
 MalwareFeeds_inspection.ipynb, MalwareFeeds_inspection_sections.ipynb, File Variations_sections.ipynb, File Variations_resources.ipynb
```
Those scripts are self-contained with comments. They are exploring the variations within the feeds on file level, section level and resources level. 

### Systematic analysis -- Top to Bottom Fingerprinting Approach

```
Fingerprinting_extract_G1.ipynb
Fingerprinting_analyse_G1.ipynb
```
Those scripts are self-contained with comments. They are systematically follow Top to Bottom appraoch to cluster based on File level, then section level. 

Note: We provided separate ipynb for G2 sections and G3 sections to make it easier for analysis.

### Systematic analysis -- Bottom to Top Fingerprinting Approach

```
Fingerprinting_extract_G1_sec.ipynb
Fingerprinting_analyse_G1_sec.ipynb
```
Those scripts are self-contained with comments. They are systematically follow Bottom  to Top appraoch to cluster based on section level first then file level. 

Note: We provided separate ipynb for G2 and its sections, G3 and its sections and G4 and its sections to make it easier for analysis. 


### Insights 

```
insights.ipynb
```
This scripts contains results and visualisations obtained from all four groups of datasets. 


# Note
Some of the data `/data` has not been uploaded here due to their size that exceeds 1G.
